      <p style="font-size: large;">Habits are nothing, but you. Habits are the ones which define your character and life. Studies have proved that 40 percent of your actions are not conscious decisions but habits.
        So, isn't it very crucial to build and maintain healthy habits? Also, forming and maintaining a routine is not quite easy.</p>
        <hr>
      <ol style="font-size: large;">
        <li>Start Small - In order to create a new habit, there isn‚Äôt a need to put much effort. A tiny and simple behaviour change daily can compound into great results.
            For instance, learning a new word every day can make a difference in your vocabulary knowledge.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Devote your time - Choosing a specific time for the habit which you want to make can help you. If you opt to make writing a habit, choose a certain time and location where you will forget the entire world and get lost into it. On a long run, your mind automatically commands you to pursue the custom at that particular time.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Repeat - When you follow a habit repeatedly, it soon becomes a reflex action. Scientists have shown that when a certain action is followed without any interval for 21 days straight, the habit gets accustomed into your life. Do not give a break for unnecessary reasons in between as much as you can (even when the satan tempts you to do soüòà). Try to give a comeback as soon as possible even if you require a break (I know it‚Äôs impossible to be perfect always‚ú®).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Streak - Following your routine daily can eventually lead it to a streak. Also, tracking your habits will show visual results of your improvement and create a sense of hope for you to follow it regularly. You will get a outlook of how well you have been performing and it will provide you also a considerable amount of satisfaction (In my case,I feel happy seeing my streak in duolingoüòå)</li>
        <br>
        <li>Environment - Customise your environment in such a way that it tempts you to do the routine more often. If you are obsessed with photography and like to take pictures everydayüì∏ (to improve your photographic creativity), you can design your room with pictures of famous photographers and your favourite pics. This will create a good vibe and surely will drive you to take action.</li>
